Hello! This is a quick tutorial on how to use PhantomGrabberV2. 
First, extract the ZIP file. 
Then, open the .exe file named PhantomGrabberV2 
(NOTE: If it doesn't open, it may be your Antivirus. Antivirus detect hacking tools as malware, giving you then a false alarm. To proceed, just disable your Antivirus). 
When you open the app, you will see some options.
Give a name to your stub and select a Icon if you want.
Then, in the appropriate boxes, paste your Discord Webhook link, so that when you get a hit the info is sent to a server you would like to be sent to.
After that, select which type of information you would like to get when the person opens the stub.
Generate the stub and that's it! You should now see that there is a new folder named "Builds".
In that folder, you can see your generated stub.
Send the stub to your victim and if they open it, you got a hit!
Enjoy!
